# Dulux Paint

This repository is about marketing segmentation for **Dulux**, a paint company. The objective was to classify lead in with potential or no potential, the main challenge faced is the varaiables we hade. In the first model we had about 5 variables, no customer life cycle was possible to build. 

# Data set 

1. Dataset Dulux2503.xlsx, it is the data set used during the first **EDA**. 


# Markdown and script 

**Dataset_1.rmd** this document generate the second data set, we use this one as main data set

**EDA.Rmd**  this is the initial analysis, it includes data transformation and a first exploration of models. This includes part of modelling

**Models.Rmd**  this is the development of a stcaking model, in this markdown we use the stack method. It is still an exploration. 


# Python scripts 

This is new to this project. 

**remarks_analysis.ipnb** this notebook check the filed remarks, this notebook is not used.

**models.ipynb**, this noteboom is a transcription of the dataset_1.Rmd R mardown. It covers the minimum the results are very similar to R but not exactly we face the problem of implementation here. This notebook does not include the tree model built in dataset_1.Rmd. As it is in **Python** the syntax is different as not expected.
